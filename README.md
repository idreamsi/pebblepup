Pebble Rocks Boulder is our first hardware hackathon. We used the Pebble Time, smartstraps, Arduinos, LED, 3D printers, and more to make a robot controlled with your Time through your smartphone.

Check out the project's [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/team-wow-hax/pebble-pup) page for pictures and videos.
